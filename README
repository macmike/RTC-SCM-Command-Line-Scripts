====RTC SCM Command Line Scripts: scmload===

Loads the contents of a component from a Jazz SCM stream to the current directory
Usage: scmload "<stream_name>" "<component_name>"

==Readme==
Simple script to wrap the Jazz SCM command line (assumed to be on the path) to allow users to load contents from a component in a stream to a local directory in just one command. 

Using this script will involve the creation of an RTC repository workspace, since at the time of writing this can't be removed using the command line you may wish to tidy them up using the GUI.
